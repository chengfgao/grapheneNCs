My undegraduate Research work was described in my thesis "Understanding Onsager Phenomenological Matrix of Interfacial Friction and Heat
Transfer in Graphene Nanochannels". 

A poster from UC Berkeley's College of Chemistry Research Symposium in 2019 is included

Legacy codes are organized as follows:

init_coordinate: scripts for generating initial coordinates of liquid and graphenes.
lammps scripts: input file for running lammps.
postprocessing: scripts for extracting physical information from lammps outputs.
